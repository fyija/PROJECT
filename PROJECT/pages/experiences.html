  <span class="elemento1"> In Computer Programming, programmers should know the basic steps first and try to solve the problem. Programmers should be a wide thinker especially in logics. Be creative, innovative and inventive programmer. Don't worry if your Website doesn't work right, don't feel furious and hopeless, especially when a programmer is beginner, patience and calmness are a must always. Sometimes, I may don't get the logic and solution to my Website due to frustration but I do trust myself that I can do it. Trials and failures are important, it teaches me to learn more, be more prouductive. </p>
  <p>Experience shows that the success of a programming course critically depends on the choice of these examples. </p>
  <p>"Everyone should know how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think." -Steve Jobs</p>
